## Proponent Profile

RouteScouts is an organization of four members: Lucas Hossack, Deanna Wing Yan Ip, Shuet-Ching Christina Lo, and Joan Ching Kwan Tam. We are aiming to create a product over the next 8 months that will help us to reach our main vision of winning the Capstone Fair. We will do this by creating a streamlined UI and incorporating Augmented Reality into our project. This will ensure that the project has real life applications while using a professional design. The motivation behind this project is our interest in IoT sensors and data, as well as programming. By combining the two, we have created this project idea of visualizing sensor data on a map while efficiently routing maintenance crews using algorithms.

## Project Sponsor Profile

SensorUp is an award winning IoT company and leader in IoT interoperability. They create industrial grade IoT solutions leveraging their SensorThings Platform for customers. SensorUp empowers innovators to develop their IoT apps quickly and easily, all in accordance with the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards. They provide IoT solutions using their OGC SensorThings API. The API is based on the relational connections between entities in the system and how they are used to model systems in the real world. Being flexible, the API can model any IoT sensing device from any vertical industry as a Thing and currently has many different applications. For example, the SensorThings API is currently used for first responders, smart field operations, and smart cities. By using SensorUp, clients can mitigate risks, enhance efficiency, and improve safety. SensorUp provides their clients with different services, such as apps that show environmental and situational information, as well as efficiency dashboards to show overall performance data from sensors.

## Client/user Profile

The clients and users of this product will use the results of this project to maintain their robots more efficiently. By providing the clients with a dashboard showing when their robots will require maintenance or when they should perform maintenance, clients will reduce downtime. There will be three separate user bases in this project as described in the project description: the admin team, the IOC manager, and the maintenance crews. The admin team will handle the simulation 

Our project takes any robots that output sensor data and analyzes the data to determine when maintenance is required. Three separate groups of users will be involved in this project. The first group is the admin team who takes in the sensor data and analyzes it, performing routing algorithms as necessary based on the results of the analysis. The second group is the IOC Manager, who will be provided with a frontend display that visualizes the sensor data. Data that will be shown includes the current state of the robots, a prediction of when they will require maintenance, as well as a map of where the robots are located. When maintenance is needed, the manager will send out an alert to the nearest qualified worker to go and perform repairs. These maintenance workers are the third group of users, who will have a frontend display showing the most efficient route to the robot on a map. When they arrive at the location, the workers will then use an app involving Augmented Reality that will show them relevant data needed for maintenance or repairs.

Many companies have assets that are dispersed across large geographic areas. When these assets fail or require maintenance, crews need to perform repairs efficiently to reduce downtime. Equipment malfunctions may be preceded by weak signals that can be analyzed or transmitted by IoT sensors. Additionally, some equipment may have higher economic priority than other equipment, and thus is a higher priority to be repaired in the case of simultaneous malfunctions. Of course, there are costs associated with having maintenance crews traveling more than necessary. That is, travel time costs companies money in wages as well as fuel and wear on vehicles. Our solution provides a web interface for both data analytics, visualization and control of the network for maintenance crew management, as well as an economically optimized route planning and optimization tool for crews on the ground. The visualization and control interface allows historic data to be presented and interpreted, to help identify patterns in failures over time, geographically, and otherwise. Additionally this control interface will allow priorities and meta-data to be set for nodes in the network. The route planning tool is built to optimize time usage by maintenance crews by reducing travel time between machinery, and prioritizing repairs on higher value machinery.

# Project Performance Framework
## Objectives, outputs, outcomes and criteria
> Identify and define project objectives, outputs and outcomes as well as a measurement criteria. 
> -	Objectives: Define what the project is trying to achieve.
> -	Outputs: Deliverables and products produced by the project.
> -	Outcomes: Impact you are working to realize such as behaviours and practices that results from the outputs. They can be short, medium or long term.

Item | Project Objectives | Project Outputs | Project Outcomes | Measurement Criteria
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
1 | | | |
2 | | | |

> For the measurement criteria provide a statement that describes what the project will accomplish and the performance measure. The project objectives whenever possible should be written to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely (SMART). The measurement criteria specifies a metric(s) that will measure success.  

## Project Performance Measurement Plan
> For each project objective and measurement criteria identified in the above table, indicate the methods used to measure, who is responsible, frequency of measurement, key targets and reporting on results. For example, if there are three(3) project objectives, fill out a performance measurement plan for each objective.
