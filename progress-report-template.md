# Milestone Overview
## Summary of Work Accomplished During this Period

Over the past few weeks, we have completed work largely based upon the schedule we set in our project proposal. The deliverables expected to be completed by this point in time include identifying tasks and users, as well as creating prototypes of our interfaces. We have created a document containing tasks that the IOC and maintenance crew interfaces should be able to perform, split up into 4 separate categories: Must have tasks, should have tasks, could have tasks, as well as tasks that can be excluded. Must have tasks are tasks that the interface requires to function based upon our project specifications. Should have tasks are ones that are not essential to the function of the interface, but should be included. Could have tasks are tasks that we can implement if time permits, but are largely unnecessary. Finally, excluded tasks are ones that are not required and could be detrimental to the functioning of the interface.

After completing the document of tasks, each member was required to submit a paper prototype of the interface. By having each member contribute, different ideas were shared and discussed for the final low-fidelity prototype. Once having decided on a general layout, work began on creating a mockup of the interface using Microsoft PowerPoint. 


> Template Instructions: Describe the work accomplished in this phase. Include a brief summary of the work accomplished in comparison to the work plan. Provide relevant samples of the work progress, that is useful for evaluating the progress, such as URLs of prototype, operational results, pictures of field work, sample data collected, URL of code repository, etc.
