# Project Overview
## Project Name
## Project Description

Technology today is inevitably moving towards partial and total automation. Whether it'd be in factories or home delivery services, more robots designed for task automation are entering the market, each bringing their own complexities and design specifications. However robots have their limitations and they cannot fix themselves or each other. Other issues include:
- Training maintenance crews to learn how to maintain new robots as well as retain the knowledge of technical specifications of every current robot within a company is difficult and strenuous. 
- Expensive to hire specific technicians for every type of robot.
- Warehouses can be the size of twenty eight football fields, therefore it is hard to track down the location of each malfunctioning robots, especially those that are mobile. 
- In fast-paced environments, downtime of task automation robots immediately result in loss of revenue.
This is why we propose to create a software that will reduce downtime and improve service technician efficiency through an Integrated Operation Center (IOC). This IOC will contain a dispatch system that finds the nearest qualified worker to service a malfunctioning robot and an intuitive Augmented Reality (AR) system to empower service crews to repair robots more efficiently and safely.

> Provide a short narrative description of the project.  Identify/describe any technical and business problem that would be solved, the key benefits and how the project aligns with/supports the strategic direction/objectives of the proponent organization or members, its collaborators, and clients/users.

## Proponent Profile

RouteScouts is an organization of four members: Lucas Hossack, Deanna Wing Yan Ip, Shuet-Ching Christina Lo, and Joan Ching Kwan Tam. We are aiming to create a product over the next 8 months that will help us to reach our main vision of winning the Capstone Fair. We will do this by creating a streamlined UI and incorporating Augmented Reality into our project. This will ensure that the project has real life applications while using a professional design. The motivation behind this project is our interest in in using IoT sensors and data to help companies to lower operational costs. As a whole, we are also interested in innovations in tech regarding geospatial data. By combining our two interests, we have created this project idea of visualizing sensor data on a map while efficiently routing maintenance crews using algorithms.

## Client/user Profile

Our clients are companies that have robots which are dispersed across large geographic areas. When these robots fail or require maintenance, crews need to perform repairs efficiently to reduce downtime. These malfunctions may be preceded by weak signals that can be analyzed or transmitted by IoT sensors. In the case of simultaneous malfunctions, some of these robots may have higher economic priority than other robots, and thus are a higher priority to be repaired. Having maintenance crews travel to repair these robots costs our clients money in terms of wages as well as fuel and wear on vehicles. To help minimize this cost, we will provide the ground crews with an economically optimized route planning and optimization tool to direct them to the robots. This route planning tool will optimize time usage by maintenance crews by reducing travel time between machinery, and prioritizing repairs on higher value machinery. Management will also use a given web interface that will show both data analytics, visualization and control of the network of robots to optimize use of available ground crew. By providing the clients with visualized data that will show when to perform repairs as well as a route optimization tool, our clients will be able to optimize and prioritize maintenance and increase revenue.

Three separate groups of users will be involved in this project. The first group is the admin team who takes in the sensor data and analyzes it, performing routing algorithms as necessary based on the results of the analysis. The second group is the IOC Manager, who will be provided with a frontend display that visualizes the sensor data. Data that will be shown includes the current state of the robots, a prediction of when they will require maintenance, as well as a map of where the robots are located. When maintenance is needed, the manager will send out an alert to the nearest qualified worker to go and perform repairs. These maintenance workers are the third group of users, who will have a map on a frontend display showing the most efficient route to the robot. When they arrive at the location, the workers will then use a mobile app involving Augmented Reality that will show them relevant data needed for efficient maintenance and repairs.

# Project Performance Framework
## Objectives, outputs, outcomes and criteria
Objectives: Monitor and collect status of internet-connected robots over time. Provide failure, critical and historic information of individual robots to maintenance crews during repairs. Provide relevant information to managers and maintenance crews.

This project provides interfaces for two user groups involved in the maintenance and repair of geographically distributed robots which are monitored by internet-connected sensors. The first interface, the IOC allows a dispatcher to visualize the location, status and relevant statistics of the robots and maintenance crews through a web-based interface. Additionally, this interface will provide a means to push notifications and itinerary items to various maintenance crews. The second interface is accessible on a maintenance worker's cellular device. It provides the maintenance crew with information regarding which robot should be repaired next and historic data regarding this robot to aid in diagnosing issues and performing repairs. Additionally the maintenance crew's interface will contain a smartphone based augmented reality interface which provides information overlaid over the robot to aid in repairs. 

The use of this system will reduce maintenance costs and downtime for robots. This will result in cost savings for fuel and , from efficient routing. Maintenance teams will be able to perform repairs faster. An additional objective is to create and improve analytics for the fleet of robots.

# Project Issues and Risks
## Issue Identification
> Specify any major policy, standards, data, technical, partnership and/or client engagement issues that need to be addressed in order for the project to be successful. 
The issues that will affect the success and completion of our project have been identified as the following:

1. We have very limited knowledge regarding machinary and their maintenance. 
2. We do not know what kind of sensor data is commonly collected from machinery.
3. We do not know the safety standards currently followed in the end user's work environment that may influence how we should design the system.

To address issues 1, 2, and 3, we need to research the machinery that is currently being used in environments such as warehouses and fulfillement centers. We will contact ATTAbotics which is a start-up company in Calgary that develops automated fulfillment systems. Doing this, we hope to gain a general understanding of the different types of machinery used in this field, the sensor data that is collected from the machinery, the frequency of scheduled maintenance, as well as the general procedures followed during maintenance.

## Feasibility and Risk 

> Identify and evaluate potential challenges or risks in completing and/or sustaining the project.  Please fill out the table and add any other applicable risks.  Examples of risks include: commitment risks, organization risks, contracting risks, technical risks, financial risks, human resources risks (such as the availability of qualified personnel or experienced personnel), project dependencies and/or policy issues related to data access (i.e. licensing, intellectual property, copyright, security, privacy etc). 

No. | Risk Description | Severity (H/M/L) | Probability (H/M/L) | Mitigation strategies for dealing with each risk 
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
1 |A User Interface (UI) that is not intuitive and is difficult to use. |M |M |We will use techniques taught in SENG300 (Introduction to Software Engineering) and CPSC481 (Introduction to Human Computer Interaction) to design and test the user interface before building. These techniques includes using Task-Centered System Design (TCSD), low fidelity paper prototyping, and Wizard of Oz, and all of these use paper or a simple mock-up software to design the UI before actually writing the code. This way, we will be able to make changes to our design easily and have a solid visualization of our UI and the functionality of it before we code. | 
2 |A malfunctioning and/or unreliable AR assistance system due to the AR tech being very new and still in a developmental stage. |H |H |We are using ARcore for our project, which is still very new and is known to be unreliable at detecting uneven surfaces due to its current lack of vertical surface detection. If this becomes an issue in our project, we will attach QR stickers to the robots to help mount images onto the robot in AR.|
3 |A innefficient and/or ineffective routing system. |M |M |We will use algorithms taught in ENGO351 and ENGO451 such as Dijkstra, as well as conduct research on other TSP algorithms to decide on which one best suits our project. |
4 |An application that does not integrate the different technical portions of our system fluidly. |M |M |Instead of building a separate mobile application for the AR portion of our project, we will look into developing a mobile web application so that both the desktop based IOC and the mobile based AR will be written with the same tool chain, and therefore will be easier to integrate together. |
5 |Lack of information security on servers. |H |L |We will be using https so that server security will not be a risk. |
6 |Finished application hinders worker safety. |H |L |We will put a disclaimer in the terms of use, as well as warnings before the application starts up. |
7 |The project is not finished before major deadlines such as the Capstone Fair. |H |L |We will follow our project implementation plan that we wrote to ensure that we stay on schedule. We also be using Agile methodology so that we have a working product after each sprint. |
8 |Member(s) of our capstone group withdraws from the course. |H |L |We will sign a group contract to present the consequences of dropping the course to each group member. We will also keep a strict policy regarding documentation on our code and our work to help with transitioning work between group members. This way, if a group member withdraws or is unavailable to work on a portion of the project, another group member will understand what the current state of that portion as well as what is yet to be done. |
9 |The project is over budget. |M |L |To reduce our budget, we will research and use open source libraries as an alternative to buying licences. We will also use the API provided by SensorUp. |
10 |Member illness causes project to be behind schedule. |L |L |We will maintain clear communication between members so that we are all informed when a member is ill. If this occurs, we will discuss postponing internal deadlines and/or split the ill member's work amongst the rest of the group to finish so that we are back on schedule. Thoroughly documenting work will also help us when assigning partially completed work from one member to another. |

> To demonstrate feasibility, make reference to past research, pilot projects, demonstrations, previous experience, and reports.

## Communications Plan and Accessibility of Project Results

Communication on the progress of the project between our organization, collaborating organizations, and clients/users will be done during major milestones throughout the next 6-7 months. These milestones include the mid-semester progress report presentations/reports, the final presentation/reports, as well as the Capstone Fair. In the progress reports we will be showing the work that we have done up to that point, where we are in the context of our project implementation plan, and future work to be done. The presentations for these progress reports will be presented in front of a spokesperson with our collaborating organization SensorUp and project advisor, Steve Liang. The final report will contain in-depth details on our completed project and we will be presenting our completed project both in the final presentation and at the Capstone Fair. In the final presentations, we will again be presenting in front of Dr.Liang. For the Capstone Fair, we will be showing the final project results to our clients and users, as well as prospective clients for the future.

Within our organization and collaborating organizations, we are using messaging applications in order to share and disseminate results. For example we have kept in constant communication with Dr.Liang using Slack. With Slack, we are sharing the progress we have made in our research and project on a nearly weekly basis through messages. As well, we have been using Slack to set up  physical or video meetings with Dr. Liang to have him check upon our progress and see if he has any concerns. Internally as RouteScouts, we have been using both Slack and Facebook Messenger to share our individual progress as well as plan meetings with the rest of the organization. For example, in order to approve a pull request on GitHub, we have messaged each other that a change has been made, and to ask other members to review the request. Other members will then know of this pull request and approve if the changes made are acceptable. This method of internal communication will continue to be used throughout this project at a greater frequency as we move into writing code and ensuring there are no project conflicts. 

> Describe how you will share and disseminate results of your project amongst your organization, the collaborating organizations as well and clients/users (i.e., presentations, post on the web, conferences, demonstrations, press releases etc.).
